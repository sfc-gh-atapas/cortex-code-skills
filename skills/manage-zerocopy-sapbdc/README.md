## Overview

The zero-copy connector enables seamless, bi-directional data sharing between SAP Business Data Cloud and Snowflake without copying data. SAP data products become queryable in Snowflake as **catalog-linked databases**, and Snowflake databases can be published back to SAP BDC as data products.

This skill provides five workflows accessible from a single menu:

| # | Workflow | Description |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Create Connector** | Create a new zero-copy connector and enroll it with SAP BDC |
| 2 | **Consume** | Mount SAP BDC data products as catalog-linked databases |
| 3 | **Publish** | Share a Snowflake database back to SAP BDC as a data product |
| 4 | **Analyze** | Explore, query, and join data from mounted SAP data products |
| 5 | **Troubleshoot** | Diagnose and fix connector, CLD, and publishing issues |

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill, ensure:

1. **SAP BDC Connect for Snowflake Terms accepted** — An `ORGADMIN` must accept the SAP® BDC Connect for Snowflake Terms in Snowsight (Admin » Terms » Snowflake Marketplace section). This only needs to be done once per Snowflake organization.
2. **SAP-side setup complete** — Your SAP administrator has provisioned SAP Business Data Cloud and other associated SAP services
3. **Snowflake privileges** — Your role has the necessary privileges (see [Privileges](#privileges) below).

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Skill

The skill lives in the Snowflake-Solutions internal repository. Clone the whole repo and locate the skill folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:Snowflake-Solutions/cortex-code-skills.git
cd cortex-code-skills/skills/manage-zerocopy-sapbdc
```

For external (Snowflake-Labs) distribution, the skill will be published separately at `https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/cortex-code-skills` (forthcoming).

### Step 2: Install

#### Cortex Code (CLI)

Copy the `manage-zerocopy-sapbdc` folder (which includes the CSN Generator as a sub-skill) to install.

#### Option A: Project-local (current project only)

```
cp -r manage-zerocopy-sapbdc /path/to/project/.cortex/skills/
```

#### Option B: Global (all projects)

```
cp -r manage-zerocopy-sapbdc ~/.snowflake/cortex/skills/
```

Or if `$SNOWFLAKE_HOME` is set:

```
cp -r manage-zerocopy-sapbdc $SNOWFLAKE_HOME/cortex/skills/
```

#### Snowsight Workspace

1. In Snowsight, go to **Projects > Workspaces** in the left navigation.
2. Create a new workspace if you don't have one already.
3. Click the **Cortex Code** icon on the right side (the blue icon with the star) to open a chat panel.
4. Click the **+** icon in the chat panel and select **Upload Skill Folder(s)**.
5. Select the `manage-zerocopy-sapbdc` folder from your local machine.

The skill will be available via the same trigger phrases listed in [Getting Started](#getting-started).

## Getting Started

Simply mention any of these trigger phrases in Cortex Code:

- "SAP BDC connector"
- "SAP data product"
- "zerocopy connector"
- "SAP BDC Connect"
- "catalog-linked database"
- "publish to SAP"
- "SAP troubleshoot"
- "SAP share back"

The skill will present a menu with five options every time it is invoked.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Create a New Zero-Copy Connector

**Purpose:** Create a new zerocopy connector and enroll it with SAP BDC.

A Snowflake account can have multiple zero-copy connectors (e.g., one per SAP BDC tenant or business unit).

**What it does:**
1. Creates the database, schema, and connector object
2. Derives the Snowflake account URL for SAP for Me registration
3. Connects the connector using the invitation link from SAP

**You will need:**
- A database and schema for the connector
- Access to SAP for Me to generate the invitation link

### Use Case 2: Consume Data Products

**Purpose:** Mount SAP BDC data products as catalog-linked databases in Snowflake.

**What it does:**
1. Selects an existing CONNECTED connector (or routes to Create if none exist)
2. Lists available SAP data products
3. Creates catalog-linked database(s) for selected data products
4. Previews the data

**You will need:**
- An active (CONNECTED) zerocopy connector
- The name(s) of data products you want to mount

### Use Case 3: Publish a Data Product

**Purpose:** Share a Snowflake database back to SAP BDC as a new data product.

**What it does:**
1. Verifies the connector is connected and share-back is enabled
2. Helps you identify which tables to publish
3. Converts FDN (standard Snowflake) tables to Iceberg V3 if needed, with two options:
   - **CTAS (one-time snapshot)** — creates static Iceberg copies
   - **Dynamic Iceberg Tables (automatic sync)** — creates dynamic tables that refresh from the source on a configurable target lag
4. Verifies all Iceberg table prerequisites (`CATALOG = 'SNOWFLAKE'`, `STORAGE_SERIALIZATION_POLICY = 'COMPATIBLE'`, `ENABLE_ICEBERG_MERGE_ON_READ = FALSE`)
5. Generates a CSN Interop v1.2 document via the **SAP CSN Generator** sub-skill (or accepts a user-provided CSN file)
6. Creates a Snowflake share with proper grants and associates it with the connector
7. Generates ORD metadata (title, description) with intelligent defaults from table inspection
8. Publishes the data product with ORD metadata and CSN schema

**You will need:**
- An active (CONNECTED) zerocopy connector
- Iceberg V3 tables with copy-on-write enabled (Snowflake-managed catalog), or standard FDN tables that the skill will convert
- ORD metadata (title, description) for the data product — the skill proposes defaults
- A CSN (Core Schema Notation) JSON document — the skill can generate a full CSN Interop v1.2 document via the CSN Generator

### Use Case 4: Analyze Shared Data

**Purpose:** Explore, query, and analyze SAP data products already mounted in Snowflake.

**What it does:**
1. Discovers catalog-linked databases and their tables
2. Explores table schemas and sample data
3. Checks for auto-generated Semantic Views in the `snowflake$` schema (created from SAP CSN)
4. Offers Cortex Analyst natural-language querying via Semantic Views, or direct SQL
5. Writes and runs analytical queries (including cross-database joins)
6. Optionally persists results as native Snowflake tables (CTAS)

**You will need:**
- At least one catalog-linked database already created
- A business question or analysis goal

### Use Case 5: Troubleshoot

**Purpose:** Diagnose and fix connector, CLD, and publishing issues.

**What it covers:**
- `CONNECT_ERROR` / `DISCONNECT_ERROR` resolution
- Catalog-linked database creation failures
- CLD shows no tables (grant/role verification, sync not complete, or SAP-side not provisioned)
- Missing `snowflake$` schema (SAP data product published without CSN document)
- `snowflake$` schema exists but no Semantic View (CSN document incomplete/malformed)
- Publishing / share-back issues (Iceberg prerequisites, share grants, ORD/CSN validation)
- Data freshness / sync problems (CLD status check, SUSPEND/RESUME DISCOVERY, per-table Iceberg metadata refresh, sync interval tuning)
- Privilege and access denied errors
- General diagnostic collection for Snowflake Support escalation

## SAP CSN Generator (Sub-Skill)

The **csn-generator** sub-skill generates [SAP CSN Interop v1.2](https://sap.github.io/csn-interop-specification/) JSON files from Snowflake table metadata or Semantic Views. It is invoked by the Publish workflow when the user needs a CSN document.

**Key capabilities:**
- Three generation modes: from a Semantic View, by creating a Semantic View first, or directly from raw INFORMATION_SCHEMA metadata
- Auto-infers 40+ annotation types across all 10 CSN Interop extension vocabularies (@EndUserText, @Semantics, @ObjectModel, @PersonalData, @Aggregation, @AnalyticsDetails, @Consumption, @DataIntegration, @ODM, @EntityRelationship)
- Detects PII from Snowflake masking policies and column name heuristics
- Classifies entities as FACT, DIMENSION, TEXT, bridge/link, or DATA_STRUCTURE
- Infers associations heuristically when PK/FK constraints are unavailable
- Filters CDC/pipeline metadata columns (Openflow, Fivetran, Stitch, Airbyte)
- Display-label convention choice: Original (preserve Snowflake source names, default) or PascalCase (cosmetic SAP-style labels for `@EndUserText.label` only). Entity and element keys are always UPPERCASE matching Snowflake — required by SAP Datasphere for remote-table resolution. The 200+ word SAP-aware dictionary is used for label generation.
- `kind: context` namespacing (SAP BDC standard)
- Interactive refinement with mandatory association and PII reviews
- No Python or external dependencies — runs entirely through Cortex Code SQL + JSON assembly

See `csn-generator/README.md` for full documentation.

## Key Concepts

### Connector States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `NEW` | Created but not connected |
| `CONNECTING` | Connection in progress |
| `CONNECTED` | Active — can create CLDs and publish |
| `CONNECT_ERROR` | Connection failed — check `connection_error` |
| `DISCONNECTING` | Disconnection in progress |
| `DISCONNECTED` | Disconnected — can reconnect |
| `DISCONNECT_ERROR` | Disconnection failed |
| `DELETED` | Connector has been dropped (permanent, no UNDROP) |

### Catalog-Linked Databases

When you mount an SAP data product, Snowflake creates a catalog-linked database (CLD). Key details:
- A read-only `snowflake$` schema is auto-created with **Semantic Views** from the SAP CSN (if the data product includes a CSN document)
- Semantic Views enable **Cortex Analyst** natural-language querying of SAP data
- `SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` controls how often schema changes are discovered (30–86400 seconds)
- CLDs do **not** support `UNDROP`
- Share-back must be disabled and all CLDs must be dropped before disconnecting a connector
- Use `SYSTEM$CATALOG_LINK_STATUS` and `SYSTEM$GET_CATALOG_LINKED_DATABASE_CONFIG` to check CLD health

### Publishing Requirements

To publish Snowflake data back to SAP BDC:
- Tables must be **Iceberg V3 with copy-on-write** enabled (`ENABLE_ICEBERG_MERGE_ON_READ = FALSE`)
- Tables must use **Snowflake as the Iceberg catalog** (`CATALOG = 'SNOWFLAKE'`)
- `STORAGE_SERIALIZATION_POLICY` must be set to `'COMPATIBLE'`
- Each data product maps to a single dedicated database
- A CSN Interop v1.2 JSON document describing the schema is required
- Standard FDN tables can be converted to Iceberg V3 via CTAS or Dynamic Iceberg Tables (the skill guides this)

## Privileges

| Privilege | Scope | Required For |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `CREATE ZEROCOPY CONNECTOR` | Schema | Creating a connector |
| `OPERATE` | Connector | Connecting, disconnecting, and publishing data product (SYSTEM$SAP_PUBLISH_DATA_PRODUCT) |
| `USAGE` | Connector | Creating CLDs (also requires CREATE DATABASE on account), adding/removing shares (also requires OWNERSHIP on share) |
| `MODIFY` | Connector | Setting properties (e.g., SHARE_BACK) |
| `MONITOR` | Connector | Describing connector, showing connectors, listing shares |
| `OWNERSHIP` | Connector | Renaming or dropping |
| `CREATE DATABASE` | Account | Creating catalog-linked databases (also requires USAGE on connector) |
| `CREATE SHARE` | Account | Publishing data to SAP BDC |
